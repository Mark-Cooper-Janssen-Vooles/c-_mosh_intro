### Structs

similar to classes, called 'structures' or 'struct'. 

declaring structs: (very similar to class)
public struct RgbColor 
{
  public int Red;
  public int Green;
  public int Blue;
}

structures combined related fields and methods too. 

differences? 
Mosh doesn't use structs lol, 99% of the time. Use a structure when you want to define a small light-weight structure only.
